# ToDo---List-App
This is a simple web-based To-Do List application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. It utilizes local storage to save tasks, ensuring persistence even after the browser is closed. Big thanks and credits to - GreatStack for inspiring and guiding.
